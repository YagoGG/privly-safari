## About ##

Privly is a developing set of browser extensions for protecting content wherever it is posted on the internet. This extension allows users to view content on any website, without the host site being able to read the content. For more information on what Privly is, [read about us](https://priv.ly/pages/about).

## Development Status ##

**Pre-alpha Version**

## About this Extension ##

This extension currently supports:

* Locally served posting and injectable applications.
* All the implemented [Injectable Applications](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Injectable-Applications) of the content server.

## Installing/Testing/Submitting Bugs ##

The installation instructions are found at [Safari Extension Development Installation](https://priv.ly/pages/develop.html#SafariExtension).

Extension integration test cases are found at [test.privly.org](http://test.privly.org). If you have discovered a bug, only [open a public issue](https://github.com/privly/privly-safari/issues/new) on GitHub if it could not possibly be a security related bug. If the bug affects the security of the system, please report it privately by writing an email to [privly@privly.org](mailto:privly@privly.org). We will then fix the bug and follow a process of responsible disclosure.

There are also unit and Selenium tests, which are found in the privly-application git submodule.

## Developer Documentation ##

Discussion of system concepts and high level processes are found in the [central wiki](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki). If you want to develop an injectable application, look in the `privly-applications` folder.
